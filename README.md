# project-euler

My solutions for the first 50 or so Project Euler problems. Currently rather inscrutable, but have a gander if you want!

Long solutions (> 1 min):
 - Q 74 (~335 s)
 - Q 60 (~287 s)
 - Q 23, 43, 77 (~72 s)
 - Q 58 (~65 s)

Medium solutions (~ 10 sec):
 - Q 14, 30, 32, 36, 75

The rest should take under 5 seconds to complete.
